# My site

## ðŸ”¥ Challenge exercise ðŸ”¥

This is a ***challenge exercise***, so it's ok if you find it a bit
difficult.

Remember, partial marks are awarded for partial solutions.

## Context

One of the best parts of computer programming is sharing your work with the
world. In this lab exercise, you will create and deploy a website to the real
internet using a tool called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Unfortunately, hosting a Flask app is considerably more complex (and has
significantly more security risks), so we'll just be deploying a page built
with HTML and CSS.

## Your task

### Decide on the website you want to build

* Perhaps you could make a website to use as a portfolio and CV, which you can
  share with potential employers.
* Or you could make a page to advertise your awesome COMP1010 project.
* You could even make a webpage dedicated to
  [your love for ducks](https://theuselessweb.site/ducksarethebest.com/)
  (warning: mute your audio lest you be bombarded with immensely loud
  quacking).

Whatever you decide, make sure it is something you are comfortable with the
world seeing, since your code and website will be public.

### Program the website

You should edit `index.html` to add the contents of your website. Feel free to
add additional images, CSS and files if you want. If you have time, you can
make multiple HTML pages that link to each other.

Keep in mind that you'll get the majority of your marks from having the website
successfully set up and deployed. Only add more to your website if you want to.

Make sure to test your work by using the Live Server extension.

### Set up a GitHub account

Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and create an account. Make sure to
choose a username you like, since it will become part of your website's URL.

### Create a repository for your website

A repository is an online "folder" for your code, where you can upload it and
share it with others.

1. From the homepage, press the green "New" button.
2. For the repository name, enter `[your username].github.io`. For example,
   I would call my repository `MaddyGuthridge.github.io`.
3. Make sure to keep the repository public, since GitHub pages cannot be used
   for private repositories.
4. Choose to "Add a README file", but keep the license set to "None".
5. Finally, choose to create your repository.

### Push your website to GitHub

Once you've created the repository, you can upload your website.

1. From the main page, choose to "Add file" and use the "Upload files" option.
2. Open the folder containing your code in your file explorer.
3. Select and drag all your required files into the upload box.
4. Click the green "Commit changes" button to finalise the changes.
5. You will be returned to the homepage, where you should see that the list of
   files now contains everything you uploaded.

From there, you should be able to visit your website on the internet from any
device. The website URL will be `https://[your-username].github.io`.

Please check the website to ensure that everything loads correctly before
submitting your URL and code for marking.

## Hints and clarifications

* You do not need to have your site on its own domain. Doing that would cost
  money, which goes against our aim of making this course accessible to
  students with no additional cost.

* There is, of course, no obligation to keep your website up after it is
  marked, but we hope you make something you are proud of that you can share
  with your friends and family.

* If you do wish to take your site down after it is marked, navigate to your
  project's GitHub page at
  `https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-username].github.io`. On the
  settings tab, you should have the option to **Delete this repository**.
  Select that button and your website will be taken down.

## Marking

5 marks available.

## Submission

Congratulations on finishing the lab! For this lab, the primary task is
deploying your site on the real internet, and so you should show your tutor
your published website. If you are getting your work marked online, please send
your tutor a link to your website.
